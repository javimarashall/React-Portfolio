# React-Portfolio

## Summary 
This software application contains my portfolio powered by React. This application was built to showcase the projects I have made so far. The application contains three components, a header, a project, and a footer that are used multiple times. The application contains two pages, a home page and projects page. In the home page, the user is welcomed to the page with a photo and a brief description of myself. The page contains a navbar with links to the project page, home page, resume, and social media links. When the user clicks on the projects link, the user is directed to the projects page. In the projects page, every project is displayed in their own card containing a gif of the project, a title, a brief description, links to the deployed site and a link to the repository.
